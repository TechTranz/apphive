## Benefits of the Microapps

 * Easy to maintain.
 * Manageable to technology upgrades. 
    - For example if you want to upgrade Angular1.x monolithic application to Angular2.x, then you need to upgrade the whole application across the board at once. Mostly it will be a rewrite of entire UI at once. But if you use Microapps architecture then you can upgrade the application gradually, since entire application consists of smaller independent applications.
 * Focused features.
   - This will prevent the UI feature bolt.
 * Better User Experience.
